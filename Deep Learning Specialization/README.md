## Specialization Overview:

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that equips me with the knowledge and skills to engage in cutting-edge AI technology development. Throughout this specialization, I've mastered various neural network architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers. I've also learned strategies to enhance these models, such as Dropout and BatchNorm.

## What I've Learned:

Built and trained deep neural networks, optimizing architecture parameters.

Worked with test sets, analyzed variance in deep learning applications, and implemented industry-standard techniques and optimization algorithms.

Developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and applied neural style transfer for artistic image generation.

Trained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for tasks like language modeling, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Question Answering.

Utilized HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and more.

I've developed machine learning project leadership skills, including error diagnosis, prioritization, and mastery of diverse ML scenarios, including complex mismatched data and advanced learning techniques.

## Applied Learning Project: 
One of the highlights of this showcase is an applied learning project where I've demonstrated the practical application of deep learning in real-world scenarios. From image classification, object detection, face detection, GAN, speech recognition to music synthesis and chatbots to machine translation, this specialization has prepared me for diverse AI challenges.
