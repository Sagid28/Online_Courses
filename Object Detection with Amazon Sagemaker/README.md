# Object Detection with Amazon SageMaker
Welcome to the "Object Detection with Amazon SageMaker" project repository! This project, offered by the Coursera Project Network, is designed to help you become proficient in training and deploying an object detector using Amazon SageMaker, a powerful machine learning platform.

## About this Project
Important Note: To complete this course, you'll need an AWS account, and AWS usage charges will apply. Please ensure that you have access to SageMaker within your AWS account. If you have a new AWS account, you might need to request access to certain resources from AWS support. Additionally, prior experience with Python programming and AWS is recommended. We'll be using a SageMaker P type instance for this project, so if you don't have access to this instance type, kindly contact AWS support for assistance.

## What I have Learned
In this project-based course, I gained expertise in the following key areas:

-- Preparing data for SageMaker Object Detection.

-- Training a model using SageMaker.

-- Deploying a trained model using SageMaker.

## Skills Practiced
By completing this project, you'll have the opportunity to enhance your skills in the following categories:

-- Deep Learning

-- Machine Learning

-- Amazon SageMaker

-- Object Detection

-- Computer Vision

## Project Overview:

This course provides hands-on experience in training and deploying an object detector using Amazon SageMaker. SageMaker offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms for various tasks, and in this project, we will utilize the SSD Object Detection algorithm to create, train, and deploy a model capable of localizing faces of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.

Please Note: This course focuses on the practical aspects of the project and does not delve into the theoretical foundations of deep learning-based SSD or Object Detection. Instead, the primary emphasis is on effectively training and deploying a model using SageMaker. Prior experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be beneficial.
