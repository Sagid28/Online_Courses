# MLOps Platforms: Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML
Welcome to the "MLOps Platforms: Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML" course repository! This course provides a comprehensive learning experience in the field of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), focusing on two leading cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

## Course Overview:
In "MLOps Platforms: Amazon SageMaker and Azure ML," I embarked on a learning journey designed to empower me with practical skills in building, training, and deploying machine learning solutions within a production environment. This course was valuable for individuals interested in preparing for AWS or Azure machine learning certifications or those working (or aspiring to work) in roles such as data scientists, software engineers, software developers, data analysts, and more, where machine learning is a core competency.

Here's a succinct overview of what each week covers in this impactful course:

Week 1: Dive into data engineering with AWS technology. Get a strong foundation in machine learning on AWS, create data repositories, and implement effective data ingestion and transformation strategies.

Week 2: Develop foundational data science skills using AWS technology. Master data cleaning techniques, engage in feature engineering, conduct insightful data analysis, and craft compelling data visualizations tailored for machine learning. Leverage serverless solutions on AWS to optimize your workflow.

Week 3: Immerse yourself in the realm of machine learning models with AWS technology. Explore model selection, excel in hyperparameter tuning, conduct model training on the platform, and expertly evaluate your machine learning models.

Week 4: Unlock the potential of MLOps with AWS, the critical phase in deploying machine learning solutions into production. Topics include operationalizing machine learning models, making resource allocation decisions between CPU and GPU, and efficiently deploying and maintaining our models.

Week 5: Expand your horizons as you explore data and machine learning on another leading cloud-based platform: Azure ML.
